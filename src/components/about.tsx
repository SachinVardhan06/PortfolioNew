          Hey, I'm Sachin Vardhan — a front-end dev from India. I’ve been into
          coding for over 3 years now, ever since high school sparked my love
          for building stuff and solving problems. I’m most at home working with
          React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and I’ve also played
          around with Nest.js and Prisma. Nothing beats the feeling of finally
          cracking a tough bug or shipping a clean UI. Always learning, always
          building, and always down for new challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m open to Job opportunities where I can contribute, learn and
          grow. If you have a good opportunity that matches my skills and
          experience then don&apos;t hesitate to contact me.
        </p>
      </div>
      <Skills />
    </motion.section>
